# Loan_Repayment_Calculator

The Loan Repayment Calculator is a program designed to help users with loans understand when they will be paid off with a specific monthly payment. Instead of focusing on a minimum payment, this program enables users to determine how long it will take for a loan to be fully paid off with a set monthly payment.

Features:

Supports multiple loans with different balances and interest rates.
Provides a graphical representation of the remaining balance over time.
User-friendly command-line interface.
Allows for easy adjustment of input values and payments.

Copy code
python loan_repayment_calculator.py
Input your loan information one by one:
Balance on the loan

After entering all your loans, input the desired monthly payment for calculations.
The program will calculate and display the time it takes to pay off the loans and generate a graph showing the remaining balance over time.
